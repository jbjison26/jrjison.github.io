## About Me

Hi, I'm JR! I currently teach comparative politics and political analysis at UP Manila. I joined UP Manila in January 2026 after teaching at UP Los Baños and UP Visayas. I also had a brief stint at the University of Oslo as a member of an international team researching on political participation in South/Southeast Asian democracies.

I completed my master's in political science at Central European University and bachelor's at UP Manila, graduating *magna cum laude*. Before entering academia, I worked in the majority leader's office of the Philippine Senate.

Outside work, I travel whenever possible and read widely.

## Research Interests

As a researcher, I have published on a number of themes: political mobilization in Asia, systemic marginalization of vulnerable groups, and the intersection of civil society and formal politics, among others. I use case study and comparative methods to analyze how citizens challenge authoritarian power and navigate structural inequalities.
